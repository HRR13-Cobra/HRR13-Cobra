Hey guys, I made this basic outline to try and cut down on git issues
- if you see anything that looks wrong, or you want to add something else
please do so! Just wanted to make a basic outline of our git workflow for 
us to refer to.  Hope this helps!

////// WORKING AND MERGING LOCAL WORK TO UPSTREAM MASTER //////
	
      ***************************

	Make sure when you start working 
	for the day that you are working
	on the most recent copy of the 
	upstream master by pulling down
	from the upstream master.

	  ***************************

	$ git pull --rebase upstream master
		** for all steps refer to PULLING DOWN FROM UPSTREAM MASTER below **

	*** work on local copy ***

	$ git add
		** all changed files **

	$ git push origin master

	***** on github *****

		*** submit a pull request ***
		*** merge pull request on github ***
		*** resolve merge conflicts ***


////// PULLING DOWN FROM UPSTREAM MASTER //////

	$ git pull --rebase upstream master
		** if conflicts **

	****CONFLICT HANDLING WITH REBASE ON LOCAL****

		** go to each conflict listed in terminal **
			* path name should be listed *
			* to show use git diff *
		** once all are resolved **

		$ git add 
			* all changed files *
			* DO NOT GIT COMMITT *

		$ git rebase --continue
			* if conflicts *
				restart from line 24 (CONFLICT HANDLING WITH REBASE ON LOCAL)
			* if no conflicts *
				continue after break

	***********************************************

	NOW YOU CAN COMMIT

	$ git commit

	$ git push upstream 
		* either 'master' or 'branch'
